                    <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>My project is called Crosslands, it is a 2D video game designed and developed using the various tools such as Unity, Blender and Adobe suite. Crosslands will allow players of all skill levels to have an enjoyable time countering problems and overcoming the difficulties of managing a colony either with a friend through multiplayer or as a solo adventure. The main aim is simple, to keep your colony from going extinct. With this comes the freedom to decide how difficult you want the game to be and if the player would also like the option for it to be endless.</p>
                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <p>My project is interesting because it creates a zone where users must always be alert and thinking about their choices. With so many games within this genre, I believe they get “boring” and/or have a lack of content. It is also in my opinion a common problem for games in this genre to have a poorly developed opening tutorial for first time players. With this it creates difficultly and challenges on the programming side of things to create a never-ending video game that also engages amateur players to experience a new genre without frustration. I would like to highlight that these challenges are the driving forces behind the motivation to create this game.</p>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>With my project I plan on allowing the users/players to explore a 2D world with 3 layers, I also want the players to set their own pace/difficulty and I want to develop an easy to learn UI that has an extensive easy to follow tutorial option for the first-time players. Down the track I will have a multiplayer online aspect for those players who want to play a colony management game with their friends. In this world the players will control and manage a colony but at times can also take direct control of any colonists. This colonies aim is to make sure it does not become extinct, how the players do this will be through building and developing technologies of their choice to defend themselves of the world’s hostiles. As mentioned before there are three levels to the worlds. Layer one is underground where the players can build and explore under the worlds surface, they may even be able to create underground tunnel systems. Layer two is the surface of the world, where the player will spend a lot of their time as it will be filled with unique creatures and objects which is randomised depending on the seed they are given and that they can use to build and advance their colony through technology. Layer three is space. I want the player to be able to explore multiple worlds if they feel like it. Every world in the players universe will be randomly generated and some will be exceedingly difficult to inhabit due to unique effects like no oxygen, unexplained or discovered gases and other civilizations. On top of this I would like players (if they choose), be able to have more than one colony operating at once. Meaning if they send a few colonists to a different world through a portal or a space vessel they can manage their home colony and start a new one on a different world at the same time. Of this, I want there to be a system where powerful and big colonies can interact through unique trade and diplomatic options to avoid wars and/or create friendships. This will add a unique area of exploration as it will have a lot of strategy and possible problems for players. As I have mentioned, I want to create a game that will have endless opportunities and experiences, but for the players that like to have a winning aspect to a game I will add an option that allows the players colony to “win”. If the player decides they want a win aspect it will be a randomly picked definition that may include for example; defeating 5 other colonies through warfare or diplomacy without losing 20 colonists to battle deaths, of course this will all depend on the players chosen difficulties. In summary the features I hope to accomplish within my video game are:
                        <br>-	Underground & space exploration
                        <br>-	Multiple colonies on the go
                        <br>-	Custom difficulties
                        <br>-	Diplomacy rich aspects
                        <br>-	Colony building an advancement through research technologies
                        <br>-	Multiplayer functions
                        <br>-	Endless game play with a win aspect option
                        <br>-	Randomly generated worlds and creatures
                        <br>-	Easy to use UI
                        <br>-	Well-developed tutorial
                        <br>-	Content rich through large amounts of game assets (weapons, tools, armors/clothes building blocks etc.)</p>
                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>List of tools and software needed:
                        <br>-	Unity will be the game engine of choice
                        <br>-	Visual studio 2017/2019 to create game scripts
                        <br>-	Blender will be an asset animation creator
                        <br>-	Adobe Photoshop will be used for asset creation and graphical design
                        <br>-	Adobe illustrator will also be used for asset creation and other graphic design
                        <br>-	A PC or server to run the development tools
                        <br>-	A NAS (network accessed storage) or cloud sever for file storage.
                        <br>-	Testers to find bugs and help determine ease of use and entertainment
                        <br>-	Microsoft 365 for documentation and report creation
                        <br>-	Project management software know as Trello
                        <br>-	Github to store the teams code on a repository</p>
                    <h3>Skills required</h3>
                    <p>The skills that are required for a project like this are people who know how to program using languages likes C#, C++ and JavaScript to create code and develop the game. It also helps if they have experience using Unity and Visual studio as these are the main game development tools. Also need someone who is good with Adobe photoshop/illustrator as most of the game’s graphics will be created using them. May also need someone who has good project management skills to keep the team on track and help decided what gets developed first and what must be but back. I believe that the skills required in this circumstance can be found in one-to-two people as video games and be developed by a sole person.</p>
                    <h3>Outcome</h3>
                    <p>If my project is successful, it will create a video game that would be enjoyed by many players and provide endless amounts of entertainment and enjoyment. Hence solving the problem of a “boring” colony management game and allowing players that are new to video gaming or the genre to learn and enjoy an endless opportunity game with unique attributes. While also allowing me to develop my programming skills through the passion of video games</p>
