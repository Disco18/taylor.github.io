                    I am a Wodonga born Australian, I can’t speak any other fancy languages and my english isnt even the best ahaha. 
                    I finished my year 12 studies in 2015 where i than decided i wanted to continue studying Information technology but I got bored after studying so much of it so decided a change of scenery was needed. 
                    I then moved into the warehousing game for roughly 4 years where i studied and completed warehousing operations to break away from the tech area, till recently my partner reignited my passion for studying and IT through helping her with her university studies. 
                    I decided it's time i get back to what i love, studying and messing around with computers. However I do have a fovourite pastime which is working on my 1993 Nissan Skyline R33 GTST project car if i'm not messing around on the computer or relaxing on the lounge with my partner.
