                        <p>I am currently a student of RMIT which is a univeristy in Melbourne Australia were I am studying a Batchelor of Information technology. Some of my background I am a Wodonga born Australian. I cannot speak any other fancy languages unless you count a basic amount of HTML, CSS, and C#. In 2015, I completed my year 12 studies along with software development, games design/programming, web development, application development and information technology. It was through my schooling years I obtained my certificate III, which led me to wanting to further my studies information technology. Though I came to realise I needed a break after studying so much. I decided a change of scenery was needed and moved onto warehousing for roughly 4 years. I then studied and completed a certificate III in warehousing operations breaking me away from the tech scene. That was until recently when my partner reignited my passion for studying through helping her with her university studies. I decided it was time I get back to what I love and have a passion for, studying and messing around with game development on computers. My favourite pastime is working on my 1993 Nissan Skyline R33 GTST project car, that is if I am not relaxing on the lounge with my partner or playing video games and practicing my coding on the computer.</p>

                    <h3>
                        What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
                        Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
                    </h3>
                    <p>For me, IT started off as an interest at a young age when my uncle first showed me his computer back in the early 2000’s. I was shown how they connected two computers in different rooms and played games like command and conquer against each other and how you could play games like world of warcraft and be connected to thousands of people from all over the globe playing at the same time. This was an awesome experience for me. It was at that point I started my journey on convincing my parents I needed a computer for myself and eventually they gave in. It was when I got my first computer when my interest turned into a passion, and I started figuring out everything I was able to do from designing my own websites, hosting my own game servers, and designing video games though programming language to locking my sibling/parents out of the internet and their devices for fun. That is where my passion for learning and playing with computers started and came from.</p>

                        Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
                    </h3>
                    <p>I chose to come to RMIT because it has always been a goal to get my degree from a well known Australian university and I have heard RMIT’s Bachelor of Information Technology is one of the best structured and informative courses in the country.</p>

                        What do you expect to learn during your studies?
                    </h3>
                    <p>During my studies I expect to learn the in-depth processes and thinking behind a computer and what makes them go from a hunk of plastic and bits of metal to the helpful machines we know and love to use every day. I also expect to learn how to effectively manage and implement large scale ICT projects in an everyday business so not to have any down times on their networks (as this is imperative to most businesses when employed to manage and support their in-house IT systems). I also hope to learn a lot about programming as I really enjoy this aspect of IT and figuring out how to give a set of instructions to a computer to make it run and create everyday applications and video games.</p>

                    <h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
                    <p>To me these results were surprising in the fact I thought I was more of a visual and hands on learner, but according to the learning style test I am more of an auditory type meaning I prefer to learn via listening. Apart from this I believe these tests accurately depict my personality and creativity. As I feel that I am indeed an assertive person who likes to lead others in team environments and who likes to help people achieve their goal, despite not being the most creative person in general. If someone gives me an idea, I like to work with that and create connections to make it happen.</p>

                    <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behavior in a team? How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
                    <p>According to the results I am a diplomat who is good at listening and making connections. This means I have the potential to be a good project team leader. I feel as this is correct as when I do work in team environments, I often try to be the team leader because I know what builds a strong team and how to effectively delegate tasks to different members based on their strengths and weaknesses. When forming a team, I like to consider all member’s strengths and weaknesses. This helps build a team that thinks as one but comes at the project from different angles.</p>
