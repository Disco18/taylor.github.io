                        <p>I believe as an AFP cybercrime officer you are tasked in providing technical support and advice to assist in investigations dealing with cybercrime against the government and the nation’s infrastructure. On top of these tasks, you are required to investigate criminal activity on the dark web and other information systems. This has always been a career goal for me because I have a great passion and love for law and computers. It has always thrilled me seeing movies as young kid where the FBI will get a hacker to help them catch the enemy and bring them to justice because no one else could do it. I also thought to myself that I would be doing something awesome like that one day, making a difference in the world using a computer. It is for these reasons that I have always wanted to join the AFP and help make a difference.</p>

                        <p>There are two ways in which you can join the AFP investigative roles. One of the two ways is to train as a recruit police officer which has further requirements, those requirements are as follows. 
                            Australian citizen over the age of 18 that holds his/her valid full or provisional driver’s license. 
                            Minimum year 10 certificate accompanied by a certificate IV/diploma level qualification. Once you have met those requirements you are then required to pass their health and fitness exams. These exams ensure you are fit enough to carry out your duties as a federal police officer. They contain the requirements of passing a set number of pushups, sit-ups, and a beep test. Once you pass these exams and you have been sent an offer of employment you can than work your way up to a specialist role. Of course, this is done through your time serving as a federal police officer recruit which is 1-3 years in the job. The second way of joining the AFP in an investigative role is through their graduate program. The graduate program requires you to have completed a university degree within the last 5 years at a bachelor level. On top of this you are required to be an Australian citizen over the age of 18, have a clean driving history of 10 years and pass their ability and employment questionnaires. Once successful you will have a personal interview and on completion you will be placed into a merit pool, from there you will receive your offer of employment.</p>

                        <h3 class="head3">My qualification's & experience plan</h3>
                        <p>Currently the only qualification and experience I have to offer is from working in the IT industry as a support technician. That is why I intend to enter the Australian Federal Police through their graduate program in their cybercrime division by 2024. For me to be able to do this I will complete my studies at RMIT University and gain my qualification in Information Technology making me eligible to apply. I then plan to further my studies by obtaining a Master of Information Technology and/or a degree in counter terrorism. This will assist in progressing my career in the AFP if successful on gaining employment. While I am studying, I will add to my experience along the way via continuing to work in the IT industry. I hope this will give me an extra advantage and job readiness before applying in the future.</p>
